Plasmaglobe x Kaleidoscope<br>
<p>
What happens when you look at a plasma globe through a kaleidoscope? Magic.
The tactile response of the plasma globe adds a unique flavour of interactivity.
Using a tapered-mirror design for the kaleidoscope produces enchanting 3D effects, which take it to an entirely new level.

Infinity Mirror Cube<br>
<p>
A cube was constructed with regular mirrors forming three adjacent faces, while the opposite faces were 50/50 mirrors.
Blue electro-luminescent wire was placed inside as an illumination source.
The result is a mesmerizing kaleidoscopic infinity mirror effect. Since the faces are made from acrylic, pressing on them only makes the effect better.

Pleasant Closed Loop Pendulum Waves<br>
<p>
A relatively straightforward gif created using Processing.
Each individual dot oscillates sinusoidally along a fixed radial path. Adjacent dots have different oscillation frequencies, which results in interesting patterns.
This follows the mathematics of the "pendulum wave" phenomenon, which is explained very well in <a href="www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/PH1010/AJP000778PendulumWaves2.pdf">this paper</a>.
The difference here is that the pendula have been arranged in a circle, rather than a straight line.
As a bonus, staring at the centre of the image induces an illusion effect, where some of the dots appear to have dark centres.

Takes some rigid stainless steel ducting, flexible vinyl ducting, LEDs... and you have Freddie the robot.  Straw hat optional.
